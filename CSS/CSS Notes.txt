			selector{
				css-property: value;
				}
		</style>
	
External CSS:-
Writting CSS in a separate file and then connecting it to the HTML/markup document with the help of <link> tag is known as External CSS.
-We use <link> tag inside the head tag to connect the external CSS to the specific HTML document.
Syntax:- <link rel="stylesheet" herf="file.css">

Selectors In CSS:-
-CSS selectors are used to select HTML elements that we want to style.
-There are mainly 6 types of selectors are there.

	}

2)id Selector:- 
-It selects an HTML element based on the given id name by using id attribute.
-Id name should be unique in the entire HTML document.

		font-size: 30px;
	}
	
3)class Selector:-
-It selects numbers of elements based on the given class name by using class attribute.

	}

4)Element Selector:- 
-It is used to select numbers of elemnts from an HTML document based on their tag name.
-Element selector selects all the elements with the specific tag name in the entire document.

	}

5)Descendant Selector:-
-It is used to select some specific elements within a parent element.
e.g:- .className p{
		background-color: yellow;
	}

6) Group Selector:-
-It is used to select multiple elements at once.
-We can use class selector, id selector, element selector, or descendant selector to select multiple elements at once, and each selector should be separated by a comma.
e.g:- .className, #idName, p{
		font-weight: 300;
		font-size30px;
	}

# Pseudo classes:-
-These are used to add styles to selectors but only when selectors meets certain condition.
-Pseudo class are written using colon(:)
e.g:- selector:active/hover
    
# Pseudo elements:-
